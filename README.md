Performed EDA and fit a heart attack dataset to multiple machine learning models. 
Ended with a 90% accuracy rate. I
exported the model and used it to deploy to a webapp running through StreamLit (tool meant to expedite app creations of ML projects)!

To run the program:

streamlit run Hello.py
(File can be found in .venv and under Scripts)

Deployed:
https://heartmate.streamlit.app/
This version however isn't perfect and fully ready yet, there are some small bugs that need to be fixed.
