Certainly! Let's create a customized heart health improvement plan for this individual based on their preferences:

        - **Week 3-4**: Increase to **20 minutes** daily.
        - **Week 5 onwards**: Aim for **30 minutes** of moderate exercise (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) most days of the week.
    - **Interests**: If the person enjoys nature, consider outdoor walks or light hiking. Otherwise, indoor activities like dancing or yoga can be enjoyable.

        - **Seek Support**: Consider counseling, support groups, or apps.
        - **Replace Habits**: Replace smoking with healthier activities (e.g., chewing gum, deep breathing).

        - **Stay Motivated**: Remind yourself of the health benefits of quitting.
    - **Interests**: Engage in activities that distract from cravings, such as reading, painting, or playing a musical instrument.

4. **Meditation and Stress Management**:

        - **Daily Practice**: Start with **5-10 minutes** of mindfulness meditation.
        - **Guided Apps**: Use meditation apps for beginners.
        - **Deep Breathing**: Practice deep breaths during stressful moments.
